# **Background:**  
## *what is PUMA2?*
The PUMA2 service was setup by NCAS-CMS to provide the UK research community with centralised access to the UM on ARCHER2 and other national HPCs. It hosts mirrors of the Met Office Science Repositories and provides access to Rose & Cylc enabling submission of model simulations to ARCHER2 and other machines.
