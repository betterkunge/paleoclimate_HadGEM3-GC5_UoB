## The Unified model
[Possible the newest user guide for UM](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/doc/um/latest/um-training/index.html)

The Met Office Unified Model (UM) is the name given to the suite of numerical modelling software developed and used at the Met Office for forecast prediction across a range of timescales; from weather forecasting to climate change.

Prior to UM9.0 the UM had its own gui, the **UMUI**, which was able to control the configuration and submission of UM jobs. As of UM9.0 the UM is configured, built, jobs submitted and run by **Rose**. Thus a prerequisite of this UM course is that trainees are familiar with **Rose**.
